# Entry Level LinkedIn Scraper ðŸš€

A common issue when looking for entry-level roles on LinkedIn is that even jobs marked as "Entry Level" on LinkedIn often require 3, 4, 5, or more years of experience. I wrote this **Python scraping tool to automatically search job descriptions** so I can rule out **which jobs are entry-level and which are definitely not**.

This program gathers information about job postings by scraping a list of URLs. For each posting, the script performs a word search for any instance of the word "years" to find out how many years are required for that job. The result is appended to a spreadsheet for easy filtering and sorting.

This Google Sheet shows an example of the end result: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10PAGF_Sk1rSO-l6MxFMof6L9TIdVddewaujgGsFyYkw/edit?usp=sharing
